     <h5 class="style stylerules">
        <ol>
            <li> The game has four colored buttons: green, red, yellow, and blue. <br><br> </li>
            <li> I will create a sequence of colors that you must repeat by pressing the buttons in same order.<br><br> </li>
            <li> Each time you correctly repeat the sequence, I will add another color to the sequence.<br><br> </li>
            <li> If you make a mistake and presses the wrong button, the game is over.<br><br> </li>
            <li> You must repeat the pattern by memory, and cannot rely on a visual cue to help yourself.<br><br> </li>
            <li> The game gets progressively harder as the number of colors in the sequence increases. <br><br></li>
            <li> The goal is to get the highest score possible by creating the longest sequence without making errors.<br><br> </li>
        </ol>
